Hello! My name is Pearu and this is my primitive BlackJack Game for CodeWorks coding assignment.

Build a simple Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. It’s a single page, that opens in the browser, and lets the user play. You can find Blackjack’s rules here -> https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiMTQ3MDM2MiIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiZjZvN3psdnkyZTd3dnpwY2l0cmMiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2VuLndpa2lwZWRpYS5vcmcvd2lraS9CbGFja2phY2s_X19zPThzd2JmcmYzYzV4Z3FscGpkeWdsIn0
